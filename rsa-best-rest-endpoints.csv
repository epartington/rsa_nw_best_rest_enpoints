decoder,/decoder/stats/,assembler.meta.rate,,y,40-50,amount of meta generated per session,how much meta is being generated ber session from the *decoder.  High meta generated adds more data to aggregation stream impacting performance and aggregation rates
decoder,/decoder/stats/,capture.avg.size,bytes,,,average byte size of the captured packets,useful for caluclating or adjusting the storage retention calculator based on real values

decoder,/logs/config,log.levels,,,"info,audit,warning.failure",increased log levels could impact perfomance of the service,
decoder,/sdk/app/,packetdrops,,,,packet drops,
decoder,/sdk/app/,stats,,,,create charts to see correlation of stats on box,
*,/sys/stats,version,,,,version of appliance,

decoder,/decoder/parsers/config/,parsers.disabled,,,,"list of parsers disabled, compare to other decoders to make sure they are the same",
decoder,/decoder/parsers/stats/,feed.count,,,,"count of feeds on that service, compare to make sure they should be the same",
decoder,/decoder/parsers/stats/,parser.count,,,,"count of parsers installed, check that they are the same and the disabled parsers are also the same(if intended)",
decoder,/index/stats/,slices.hot,,,<300-400 on concentrators,number of slices open and mapped by service,
decoder,/decoder/stats,capture.kept,,,,number of packets kept vs ,

decoder,/decoder/stats,capture.processed.bytes,bytes,,,traffic after app and net filtering (used for licensing),
decoder,/decoder/,assembler.meta.rate,,,40-50,"40's should be a normal value of the number of meta created per session, Higher is more meta and could lead to sessions behind on decoders",
log decoder,/database/stats/,session.rate,,,EPS, EPS rate within a 10 second rolling window,
esa,h&w averagebytespermeta,,bytes,,,combine these two stats to get an idea of the session size to the ESA (bandwidth usage etc or changes to indexing),
